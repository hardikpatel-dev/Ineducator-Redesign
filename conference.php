                <h3>Managing Toxic Employees: Strategies For Leaders To Effectively Deal With Employee Attitude
                    Issues 2024</h3>
                <p>Working with other people is never easy, but some employees make it particularly difficult. When
                    an employee's negative attitude is not addressed properly, other team members become resentful
                    and lose respect for their leadership, and they may develop their own negative attitude. No one
                    wants a difficult or toxic employee on their team, however, it's something everyone needs to be
                    prepared to address should it arise.</p>
                <p>Challenging employees can try our patience and drain a lot of time and energy. Turning things
                    around takes skilful management and patience.</p>

                <h4>Learning Objectives:-</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognize the signs of typical toxic behaviours and discover how to move those conversations
                        forward</li>
                    <li>Identify and control the impact of toxic behaviours so that you can keep the situation from
                        escalating further.</li>
                    <li>Learn how to gain control and handle these situations by identifying the payoff.</li>
                    <li>Know how to act, not react, in resolving toxic situations so that you can lead with more
                        confidence, feel less stress, and gain more success in working and interacting with your
                        team.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Areas Covered:-</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toxic cultures decrease the ability to problem-solve, effectively communicate, and collaborate,
                        and increase the risk of mental health issues, absenteeism, and further difficult behaviours
                        such as back-stabbing, finger-pointing, and gossiping.</li>
                    <li>An organization can be considered toxic if it is ineffective as well as destructive to its
                        employees.</li>
                    <li>Negative attitudes and difficult behaviours are contagious and can create a toxic workplace
                        culture. Toxic workplaces breed toxic employees and toxic employees breed a toxic workplace.
                    </li>
                    <li>Leaders who can appropriately manage any toxic and difficult behaviours will create an
                        environment where they can effectively collaborate and thrive during challenges, and those
                        organizations that simply try to ignore toxic behaviours will struggle to be productive, service
                        their customers, and be competitive.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Background:-</h4>
                <p>Working with other people is never easy. When toxic behaviour is not addressed properly, team members
                    become resentful, they lose respect for their leadership, and they may develop their own toxic
                    behaviours. Challenging employees can try patience and drain a lot of time and energy.</p>

                <p>Turning things around takes skilful management and patience. How you and your team effectively deal
                    with toxicity can mean the difference between having a negative, drama-filled workplace, and an
                    engaged, collaborative, and productive organization. </p>

                <h4>Why Should You Attend:-</h4>
                <p>How you and your team effectively deal with negative and difficult team members can mean the
                    difference between having a toxic, drama-filled workplace, and an engaged, collaborative, and
                    productive organization.</p>
                <p>Under stress and surrounded by uncertainty, some members of our team become negative and resistant,
                    and are simply more difficult to deal with. Reducing the drama within the team depends on being able
                    to understand and respond appropriately to their behaviours.</p>
                <p>Learn successful strategies and tips for building a positive, productive workplace by knowing WHAT to
                    focus on to move these interactions forward, HOW to effectively respond, and WAYS to manage the
                    impact of their behaviour. Identify challenges associated with managing difficult employees, control
                    your own feelings effectively, and create a positive work environment so that you can End
                    frustration, and Act rather than react, to ensure a respectful, effective, and collaborative team.
